# Mem Interface Evolution

Mem is a leader in the crowded application category for personal productivity note taking and task wrangling or "second brain" applications. Mem is well funded[^1] and has a passionate user community on Slack. I am a Mem subscriber and early adopter.

[^1]: OpenAI leads \$23.5M round in Mem, an AI-powered note-taking app, from [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/10/ai-powered-note-taking-app-mem-raises-23-5m-openai/).

I like Mem because the interface is simple, implements a reasonable subset of Markdown[^2], has built-in templates and Zapier integration. Mem continues to iterate the product, but in what direction? I will leave aside the debates on the Mem community Slack regarding two popular topics: Focus on basics like search and iOS stability or Less AI, More Build Quality.

[^2]: About 60% of the Markdown Cheatsheet is implemented, but no tables yet. [Github wiki](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

The focus of this note is design goal for Mem Chat. Chat is one of Mem's AI implementations[^3] to help surface Mem content or support writing. The design team continues to experiment with large language models (LLMs) and Chat user interactions.

[^3]: When using the initial release of Chat, previously called Smart Text or MemX, I observed the Mem syntax was very "technical" and could benefit from clear sentence structure in the prompts. [MemX is too Opaque](https://mem.ai/p/8MNks0EqWJ5MQchy80ZG). 

As everyone explores the new AI-assisted interaction model, what is the ideal model? How much should the application reveal about decisions underlying the suggestions? I will use Mem Chat to explore these questions, using three scenarios:

1.  Chat Suggestions in the Sidebar

2.  Chat Navigation, and

3.  Chat Welcome

# Interactions

Overall, the Mem design team is avoiding Norman's criticism[^4] that AI chat interfaces are the "first new UI paradigm in 60 Years" where users tell the computer what to do. Unlike the prompt engineering of ChatGPT where you describe what outcome you desire, Mem is working hard to determine your intent; presumably from the content of the Mem and associated Mem collections.

[^4]: A recent paper from the astute Neilsen Norman reviews the new AI interfaces. He complains there is too much effort demanded by the user to construct useful prompts. [AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/). 

I will defer the odd rise of the ✨ spark icon as the choice to represent AI in many well-known products such as Google Photos and Notion AI. Some say "it is widely recognized as a symbol of innovation, creativity, and inspiration in the tech industry, particularly in the field of AI."[^5]

[^5]: A positive comment on the spark icon from [Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/the-unstoppable-rise-of-spark-as-ais-iconic-symbol-ca663162cccc).

Many think the spark conveys the wonder and possibility of AI. However, wonder without transparency is confusion. I think FastCompany's three icon recommendation is better.[^6] This icon set provides for a generalized approach for all content types, hybrid content generated by humans but augmented by AI. This middle content type that enhances human content is the domain of Mem. [Include sample icon?]

## #1 Chat Interaction: The Sidebar

Here is an example of Chat stepping into a Mem to provide suggestions. The use of the sidebar is nice; the refresh icon is nicely placed. I assume the ✨ spark icon is meant to indicate the top two sidebar elements are machine generated. Good so far.

![Mem Chat User Interface](images/mem-chatUI.png)

I have challenges[^7] with the origins of the content, including:

[^7]: Sample Mem sidebar extension with Chat. I appreciate the symmetry of three options in each box. But I need context for why "these three" are listed in either the Chat Suggestions or the Similar to this mem groups.

1.  The first chat recommendation is "Provide a critique on the article." What is the logic for using "on the article"? Was it because the Mem template is "Article" or the Mem is tagged "#article"?

2.  When I asked Mem to regenerate the Chat, the suggestions moved away from the article theme. Chat now seems to focus on ways to improve the research.

    ![](images/mem-chatUI%20regen.png)

Turning to the companion boxes in the UI, I understand the "Similar to this mem."[^8] The last box is called "articles," which I assume comes from the "#article" collection? I would recommend a hover tip or some visual clue why these Mems and collections where recommended.

[^8]: I do wonder why Mem is not sentence case. Mem is a product; a capital M is appropriate.

## #2 Chat Navigation: Consuming Suggestions

I do appreciate the ability to refresh Chat Suggestions; performance is super fast, so I assume Mem has cached suggestions. After refreshing a few times, I found a suggestion I wanted to explore.[^9]

[^9]: The prompt text generated by Mem is "Identify and address any potential limitations or drawbacks of using ChatGPT and PlantUML for mind mapping."

Each suggestion is a hyperlink to the "Chat" interface of Mem. This interface is a full page with a Chat icon highlighted at the top of the page. The response is polite and useful, as follows:

> Certainly, Peter. While using ChatGPT and PlantUML for mind mapping can be a powerful combination, there are a few potential limitations and drawbacks to consider:
>
> **Limited Contextual Understanding**: ChatGPT, while impressive, may not always fully grasp the context or nuances of a conversation. This could lead to inaccuracies or misunderstandings when generating mind maps based on user prompts.
>
> **Lack of Real-Time Interaction**: ChatGPT doesn't support real-time interaction. If you want to modify or expand a part of the mind map while it's being created, you might need to start over or manually edit the generated content.
>
> **Formatting Constraints**: PlantUML, while versatile, has its own syntax and formatting rules. This might limit the complexity or visual appeal of the mind maps you can create. For instance, it might not support certain types of graphical customization that other mind mapping tools offer.

I have the options to save the generated text as a new Mem or Copy the text. Nice, productive options. However, I want to return back to the Mem context that initiated this AI diversion. Does Mem provide any navigational aids next to the Mem or Copy options? No.

Mem does provide a disclaimer below the text "Mem answers questions and creates content using the knowledge you've saved and public knowledge," with a nice learn more link.[^10]

[^10]: The link is to Mem support article: [Chat with your Mem.](https://support.mem.ai/article/102-chat-with-your-mem)

Mem, however, gives me no UI element return to my work. The browser back button or Alt+Left Arrow is available. I would expect the UI to help with the following:

-   Gracefully return back to the Mem

-   If I opt to create a new Mem from the generated text, Mem should show the original Mem and the new Mem in the split pane interface.

-   Place the thumbs-up, thumbs-down rating of the generated text in the same UI location as the new Mem and Copy options. Instead the rating buttons are at the top of the text; the Mem buttons are at the bottom.

If the goal of Mem Chat is to improve my productivity, then don't erase that productivity with splintered menus and awkward navigation. My recommendation is to make the Chat button in the top navigation a toggle. The button is active when in Chat; clicking the active button will turn Chat off and return to the original Mem.

## #3 Chat Welcome: Make it Easier to Start

Imagine you are a party. You can pick between two questions: "what are your goals?" or "are you a coffee or tea fan?" Everyone will pick the second question because it is easier to answer; it gets the conversation started and might lead to bigger questions.

Mem starts with a Chat question: "What can I help with?"

[chat UI image]

Everyday I respond "what are my tasks today," and Chat responds "I don't have real-time access to your task list or calendar." However, Mem does have a Markdown convention of "[]" to create a task; Mem has collections to group Mems. It even shows "consulted sources" of my Mems. Mem even suggests a prompt "What tasks do I have for tomorrow?" that produces the same "I don't have real-time access" response.

Using the example question I raised in this section, what if Mem started with these prompts:

> Your Mems from yesterday focused on these topics [list the top 3 like Mem did in the Sidebar example above]. Then Mem asked "What topic should we continue with today?"

Even better

> You have the following meetings this week [list]. Do you need help drafting meeting invitations or review the email before you send it?

Generative AI is a journey. I appreciate the partnership with the Mem team on the journey. I'm prepared for the journey, I just want the destination to emerge. The more Mem can help, the more productive we can become.
